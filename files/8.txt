Archicad released its first file exchange based Teamwork solution in its version 5.1 in 1997, which allowed more architects
to work on the same building model simultaneously. A completely rewritten Teamwork "2.0" solution with a new database approach
came out in version 13 in 2009 named Graphisoft BIM Server. Since only the changes and differences are sent to the central storage,
this solution allows remote access to the same project over the Internet, thus allowing worldwide project collaboration and coordination.
In 2014, with the introduction of the BIMcloud, better integration is provided with standard IT solutions: browser-based management, LDAP
connection, and HTTP/HTTPS based communication. Also, new scalability options are available, by allowing multi-server layouts to be created,
with optional caching servers. Third-party vendors and some manufacturers of architectural products have compiled libraries of architectural
components for use in Archicad. The program includes Geometric Description Language used to create new components. Also, API
and ODBC database connections are supported for third party Add-On developers. Via direct API links to 4D
and 5D software such as Vico Office Suite or Tocoman iLink, the Archicad model can be exported to BIM-based cost estimation and scheduling. Archicad
is also directly linked via API to Solibri's Model checking and quality assurance tools.In addition, Graphisoft provides a direct link to Grasshopper
3D enabling a visual programming environment for parametric modelling and design.

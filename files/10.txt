When Macintosh launched in January 1984, it quickly surpassed Lisa's sluggish sales. Jobs then began assimilating increasing numbers
of Lisa staff, as he had done with the Apple II division after assuming control over Raskin's project. Newer Lisa models were eventually
introduced to address its shortcomings but, even after lowering the list price considerably, the platform failed to achieve favorable sales
numbers compared to the much less expensive Mac. The final model, the Lisa 2/10, was rebranded as the Macintosh XL to become the high-end model
in the Macintosh series. Though the documentation shipped with the original Lisa only refers to it as "The Lisa", Apple officially stated that
the name was an acronym for "Locally Integrated Software Architecture" or "LISA". Because Steve Jobs's first daughter was named Lisa Nicol
Brennan , it was sometimes inferred that the name also had a personal association, and perhaps that the acronym was a backronym
invented later to fit the name. Andy Hertzfeld states the acronym was reverse engineered from the name "Lisa" in late 1982 by the Apple marketing
team, after they had hired a marketing consultancy firm to come up with names to replace "Lisa" and "Macintosh" 
and then rejected all of the suggestions. Privately, Hertzfeld and the other software developers used "Lisa: Invented Stupid Acronym", a recursive
backronym, while computer industry pundits coined the term "Let's Invent Some Acronym" to fit the Lisa's name. Decades later, Jobs would tell his
biographer Walter Isaacson: "Obviously it was named for my daughter.

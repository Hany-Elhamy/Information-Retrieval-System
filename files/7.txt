evelopment of Archicad started in 1982 for the Apple Lisa, the predecessor of the original Apple Macintosh. Following its
launch in 1987, with Graphisoft's "Virtual Building" concept, Archicad became regarded by some as the first implementation of
BIM. However, ArchiCAD founder Gábor Bojár has acknowledged to Jonathan Ingram in an open letter that Sonata "was more advanced
in 1986 than ArchiCAD at that time", adding that it "surpassed already the matured definition of 'BIM' specified only about one
and a half decade later". Archicad has been recognized as the first CAD product on a personal computer able to create both 2D and 3D
geometry, as well as the first commercial BIM product for personal computers and considered "revolutionary" for the abilityto store large
amounts of information within the 3D model. Today, it has over 120,000 users. Archicad allows the user to work with data-enhanced parametric
objects, often called "smart objects" by users. This differs from the operational style of other CAD programs created in the 1980s. The product
allows the user to create a "virtual building" with virtual structural elements like walls, slabs, roofs, doors, windows and furniture. A large
variety of pre-designed, customizable objects come with the program.Archicad allows the user to work with either a 2D or 3D representation on the
screen. Two-dimensional drawings can be exported at any time, even though the model in the program's database always stores data in three dimensions.
Plans, elevations, and sections are generated from the three-dimensional virtual building model and are constantly updated if the user 'rebuilds'
the view. Detail drawings are based on enlarged portions of the model, with 2D detail added in.
